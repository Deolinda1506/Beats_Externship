Beats by Dr. Dre Externship Program
Overview
This 5-week externship program, designed in collaboration with Beats by Dr. Dre, is tailored for aspiring data analysts like me to develop critical skills in Python, data analysis, and sentiment analysis. I will tackle real-world business challenges through task-based projects.

Learning Objectives
By completing this program, I will gain:

Proficiency in Python: Use data science libraries for sentiment analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncover trends in datasets using statistical tools.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Apply AI tools like Gemini AI for consumer feedback analysis.
Data Visualization Skills: Create impactful visual representations of insights.
Program Structure
The program consists of five projects:
| Project                          | Duration | Description                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project 1: Toolkit Introduction | Week 1   | Introduction to Python basics, data manipulation, and program setup.                             |
| Project 2: Data Gathering        | Week 2   | Data collection and cleaning, preparing data for analysis.                                        |
| Project 3: EDA & Sentiment       | Week 3   | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and sentiment analysis using Python and visualization techniques. |
| Project 4: Consumer Insights    | Week 4   | Advanced AI tools like Gemini AI for consumer feedback analysis and insights.                     |
| Project 5: Capstone Project      | Week 5   | Integration of insights to create strategic business recommendations.                            |
